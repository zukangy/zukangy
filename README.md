### Hi, I'm Zukang ðŸ‘‹

I am a seasoned data scientist working primarily in the healthcare and finance industries. My focuses are on text classification, hardware failure prediction, and financial trading signal engineering. I have a Master's degree in Data Science from UC Berkeley. In my free time, I like to read about AI and explore possible business or research opportunities.

For my graduation project at UC Berkeley, we developed a web app which displays the latest engineering blogs from Tech companies (Meta, Amazon, Doordash, etc) and provides a chatbot for you to talk to the blogs of your interests. Our goal is to put the latest AI trends in one place and take advantage of Generative AIs to drastically shorten your reading time yet maximizing your knowledge gain. 

For now, the App is free to use!
