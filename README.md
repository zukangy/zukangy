### Hi, I'm [Zukang](www.linkedin.com/in/zukang-yang) ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist and Quantitative Trader. I am passionate about researching and exploring innovative ways of 
incorporating machine learning to harness the performance of the existing trading strategies. Lately, I am looking 
to expand my data science expertise beyond the financial sector. 

This GitHub profile of mine is created and maintained as a memoir of my learning journey in data science
and programming. There are a few repositories about some interesting projects I did over the years and now looking back 
at the codes I wrote and the confidence I gained upon the completion of each project, I am amazed by how far I've gone 
in the learning journey and how much I've improved since my first coding project.
