### Hi, I'm [Zukang](www.linkedin.com/in/zukang-yang) ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist and Quantitative Trader. I am passionate about researching and exploring innovative ways of 
incorporating machine learning to harness the performance of the existing trading strategies. Lately, I am looking 
to expand my data science expertise beyond the financial sector. 

This GitHub profile of mine is created and maintained as a memoir of my learning journey in data science
and programming. There are a few repositories about some interesting projects I did over the years. Now looking back 
at the codes I wrote and the confidence I gained upon the completion of each project, I am amazed by how far I've progressed 
in the learning journey and how much I've improved since my first coding project. 

#### A Tiny Update
One of my future goals is to invent a set of diversified algorithmic trading strategies across different asset classes, and they will be helping me manage my savings and make investment suggestions for me. I've helped my company develop various algo trading strategies, with both technical indiactors and AI-powered market signals. Not long ago, I ended the lifecycle of my very fisrt trading bot which managed about $1500 of my savings (yes I couldn't trsut my bot at first so $1.5k was all he got LOL). My debut bot was actively trading via Robinhood's API between October 2021 and May 2022. On his last day of trading, he had outperformed the SPY index by about 15% (SPY was -5% in cumulative return and my bot was +10% in the same metric). 

I am proud of what my debut bot had been capable of doing, and I have to admit that if I competed with him, I would probably underperformance him by 30% due to my human nature of panic and greediness. I am glad that my bot didn't make decisions with his emotions, but rather with data and mathematics. I am convinced that my 2.0 bot will be a more successful investor than ever!

Note: I will share the abbreviated version of the source code for my bot for your curiosity, and the original version has been kept as a private repo.
